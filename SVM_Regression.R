# Tuning your support vector regression model
# In order to improve the performance of the support vector regression 
#we will need to select the best parameters for the model.

# In our previous example, we performed an epsilon-regression, we did not set any value for epsilon ( ?? ), but it took a default value of 0.1.
# There is also a cost parameter which we can change to avoid overfitting.
# The process of choosing these parameters is called hyperparameter optimization, or model selection.
# The standard way of doing it is by doing a grid search. 
# It means we will train a lot of models for the different couples of ?? and cost, and choose the best one.

# On this graph we can see that the darker the region is the better our model is (because the RMSE is closer to zero in darker regions).
# This means we can try another grid search in a narrower range we will try with ?? values between 0 and 0.4. 
# It does not look like the cost value is having an effect for the moment so we will keep it as it is to see if it changes.
